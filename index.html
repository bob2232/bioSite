        <h1>My Biography </h1>
        <p id="description">I was born in Togo, a small country in Africa. I spent my childhood living with my grandma in a small village named Ziobga. After my grandmotherâ€™s death, I came live with my parents in the town. I got my high school diploma in 2005 and start teaching at Le Parfait middle school. I taught a math class for two years. <br>I got a visa lottery and came to the USA in 2008. I stayed home for two weeks in order to get any legal documents and after getting my social security and other important documents, I started working at Tyson as a meat cutter from 2008 to 2016.
            I study ESL at Blackhawk college to learn English because French is my first language. Because of my hard work, good communication skills, and a job well done, I was nominated for a front-line or production supervisor from 2016 till now. Willing to be an entrepreneur in a business, I have undergone small business training at Blackhawk college in 2019. <br>I am married, and I am a father of two beautiful daughters and one handsome boy. I came to the USA as a single leaving my family back home. After five years in America, I started filling out applications to bring my family to live with me. It took a lot of years, almost five years. And finally, by the grace of the Lord, they come in 2018. Now, I am living with my wife and my children. We are living together in the USA.
