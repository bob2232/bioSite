        <h1>Bob's hobby</h1>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Bob likes fishing and exercising sometimes. He spends his free time playing with his children and watching cartoons with them. </p>

            According to <em>reelcoquinafishing.Com</em>, over 45 million people go fishing each year. Fishing is one of the most outdoor activities. Many people, women, and men like to do this activity because it is a way of exercise and fan. Fishing relieves stress and helps people to relax. I personally went fishing several times and it is fantastic and fun if you catch fish. The bad side is you will be burned by the sun. It is a kind of good thing because you get vitamin D which is good for your health. Fishing is a recreational activity, but it can be also done for commercial purposes. Pablo states on his blog that “When looking for a fantastic way to improve your well-being, consider heading out for a day on the water”. By saying this, he wants to list various benefits of fishing such as enjoying the beauty of nature, reducing stress levels, and helping people focus on the present moment. Besides the fishing activity, fish contains many vitamins such as Omega3, vitamin B12, and protein which are important for a balanced diet and a healthy organism. Before fishing, you need to have a permit or fishing license.
